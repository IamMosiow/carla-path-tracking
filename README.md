# CARLA PID Path Tracking 

This project demonstrates autonomous driving using a PID controller in the CARLA simulator. It includes sensor integration (RGB camera, LIDAR, IMU), data logging, PID tuning, and path-following on a closed-loop trajectory.

## Folders
- `Code/`: Contains Python scripts for controlling the vehicle, PID implementation, and Carla client integration.
- `Data/`: Includes logged sensor data (camera images, LIDAR point clouds, IMU readings, etc.).

## Tasks Completed
1. Sensor Integration and Vehicle Control
2. PID Gain Tuning (Longitudinal & Lateral)
3. Infinite Loop Path Tracking

## Outputs
- Control action plots
- Cross track error visualizations
- Vehicle trajectory vs. desired trajectory
